Django Block Party

A django middleware component and vim plugin that offers an enhanced view of a
requests template tree and block nodes. Making it easier to navigate through
templates.

usage:

In settings Add to your middleware classes


MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES = (
    ...
    'django_block_party.middleware.VimMiddleware',
    ...

BLOCK_PARTY_ROOT = '/sites/your_site/some_log_dir/your_server_can_write_to/'

INTERNAL_IPS = ('yourip...')
DEBUG = True #middleware should do nothing if not in debug.
(DEFAULTS TO MEDIA_ROOT)

add django_block_party/vim/django_block_party.vim to your ~/.vim/plugin/ or vim plugin path.

Any request running from INTERNAL_IPS will then write a file .dbp.template_view

open vim in the /sites/your_site/ directory
:DBPOpen

This should open a block tree view. It has all the views blocks and their internal renderings.
Hitting <enter> will  call :find path/to/template, which will open the template
assuming you have the vim 'path' set up correctly.

If you need a script to add your apps template paths try this.
